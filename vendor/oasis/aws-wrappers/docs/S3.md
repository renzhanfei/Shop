# oasis/aws-wrappers for **S3** service

> **NOTE**: this document assumes you have a valid AWS profile configured for the executing user, and the IAM of this profile has at least "s3:GetObject permission on the related ARN.

> **IMPORTANT**: this document will not cover the definition of S3 and any key concepts related to it. If you are not familiar with S3, please read the official guide [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html).

The S3 wrapper in oasis/aws-wrappers is the `Oasis\Mlib\AwsWrappers\S3Client` class, which is an extension to `Aws\S3\S3Client`.

## Constructing

Compared to the base `S3Client` class, the wrapper class will set the default "version" attribute to "2006-03-01". There is no other difference between the wrapper class and the base class except this.

## Presigned URI

S3 protects your resources behind its well configured security schemes. However, some times we may need to expose certain object to the public for a limited amount of time, usually for read-only purpose. To solve this need, the wrapper class has provided an easy method `getPresignedUri()`, which will return a public accessible URI that is only valid for a short period of time:

```php
<?php

$signedUri = $s3->getPresignedUri(
    "/uploaded/20160501/929793.jpg"
);
$signedUri = $s3->getPresignedUri(
    "/uploaded/20160501/929793.jpg",
    "+50 minutes" // expires, default to 30 minutes
);
```
